-For calibration (I will go more deeply into this)

**lets focus on this because it is important

there are 3 types of calibrations 
-motor calibration 
	-od0.axis0.requested_state.AXIS_STATE_MOTOR_CALIBRATION
-encoder calibration
	-od0.axis0.requested_state.AXIS_STATE_ENCODER_OFFSET_CALIBRATION
-full calibration
	-od0.axis0.requested_state.AXIS_STATE_FULL_CALIBRATION_SEQUENCE

Now you only need to do the motor calibration the first time you plug a motor into an odrive
lets learn how to do that
-run a motor calibration
-then do 
	od0.axis0.motor.config.pre_calibrated = True
	od0.axis0.save_configuration()
	od0.axis0.reboot()


Afther this you can always test it by just typing 
	-od0.axis0.motor.config.pre_calibrated
and it should print out true

To reset, set this to False and reboot the Odrive


**what this is actually doing is modifying/setting the variables of <axis>.motor.config.phase_resistance and <axis>.motor.config.phase_inductance
