Odrive tool is very good for Debugging:

You can always test if you are able to connect to an Odrive by plugging it in and running Odrivetool

Another thing you can do with Odrive tool is test out any errors that a board may throw
Now unlike issues that may arrive within code you write, the Odrive doesn't spit out an error, you actually have to go seek it out

How do you do that
